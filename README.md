# Dr. Hunter Thompson Lockwood 

I am a settler/nonnative linguist who works for the Language Research Office in [the Myaamia Center at Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/), under [Dr. David Costa](https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/about/staff-faculty-affiliates/costa/index.html). 

## About Me

I have spent the last 15 some odd years working with and for speakers of Algonquian languages in the Ojibwe-Potawatomi and Miami-Illinois subgroups. When given the time to explain myself, I typically say that I am an [Algonquianist](https://algonquianconference.atlas-ling.ca/) (a person who studies Algonquian languages) and a [Language Documentarian](https://gmholton.github.io/documentary-linguistics/#what-is-documentary-linguistics), although much of the work I do today could be considered philology.

### Elsewhere & Otherwise

You can find out more about me through simple inquiry. My [personal website](https://hunterlockwood.github.io/), which I update only infrequently, is a good place to start.  

I try not to be active on any social media site, although I do {maintain, retain} accounts on various platforms, and tend to investigate new ones as they arise.
