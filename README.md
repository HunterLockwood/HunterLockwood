# Dr. Hunter Thompson Lockwood 

I am a settler linguist who works for the Language Researach Office in [the Myaamia Center at Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/), under Dr. David Costa. 

I have spent the last 15 some odd years working with and for speakers of Algonquian languages in the Ojibwe-Potawatomi and Miami-Illinois subgroups. When given the time to explain myself, I typically say that I am an Algonquianist (a person who studies Algonquian languages) and a Language Documentarian, although much of the work I do today could be considered philology.

I am currently revamping my personal/academic website.
